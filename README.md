# LED-control-
This project uses OpenCV and CVZone in Python to detect hand gestures, via  webcamera, sending commands to an Arduino. The Arduino controls LEDs based on number of fingers visible, enabling real-time, interactive LED control through computer vision and serial communication between the Python program and Arduino.
